# Angular_Spring_LoginExoticCar
Website made in Angular and Spring Boot for viewing exotic cars, backed by a MySQL database. The Angular front end communicates with Spring through the endpoints exposed via Spring Data Rest.

The database stores information about the car models and also stores the comments left by users for each car. Allows for the login of current users and registration of new users.

Browser cars by brand, use the search feature to find a certain car model and leave comments!

Please edit the "spring.datasource.username" and "spring.datasource.password" fields in the application.properties file in src/main/resources with the required information to access your local instance of MySQL.

Run the SQL script found inside to create the MySQL database schema. Password for every default user is "123lol".
